I like the rainy days,what the sasaki brings me is a kinda moved thing–Zing. 

Even the man had only a few days left in his life,even he knew that his head-cancer was so bad,he still devoted himself into a relationship given by God,I’m really moved,I realize that this story maybe not true,but I am willing to believe it. 

The story began from a rainy day,when the girl and her teacher first met,thanks to the photostore mistaking their photos, while love just came in this coisidence,while the chemical reaction happened. 

The girl had the same family name Ozawa as the man who happened to be her history teacher.She fell in love with him on the first met.she decided to make chances to date him,to let him feel the same way as she did.I mean who don’t like such a girl,beautiful,kind and considerable,not to mention the teacher did also feel the same way since then. 

In order to get his attention,the girl learn the subject–history so hard to achieve the deal she made with the teacher that if she got a full score in the next history exam he would date her.unfortunately she got a 99,but non’t the full score though already so closed.she felt so said that not be able to date the teacher.The girl was so straightly and so sinciecily and so longing for the date that the teacher remarked the paper to full score. 

To celibrate her good performance in the exam,the teacher dated the girl some day,and the girl insisted to go somewhere the man like,so they went to some historical places.This trip or so-called dating should have been boring but the fact of the matter is it became a realy good memery along the days after.The pictures and the blackhat with a big AI which means Love on it became a chain between them.And just from that day their relationship entered into an anther statue that they could meet each other with no reseans.I guess the teacher must had felt the same way.He kissed her in a library since then the girl knew that teacher liked her too,while the teacher had only a few days left on this world,for his cancer in head was getting worse and worse,he wouldn’t like the girl to saw him die.so on the last day he refused her to meet himself although he felt so bad and left from the city quietly without leting the girl know. But finaly she found him,she found him sick badly,she found the truth that the teacher in love with her but he had a bad cancer and he didn’t want she down. 

The girl encouraged the man to accept an operation, What moved me most is that the man wouldn’t accept the operation because he wouldn’t like to forget,to forget her sister and the girl.The girl comforted him that it was OK to accpet the operation at least there may be some possiblity to be cured,And she promised him that evenif the operation didin’t make it she would still live on positvily and good. 

The operation sucssed,As the side affection do,he forgot her. On the day he was to leave the hospital,she waited at the door,hided her own unbrella aside and asked him to share his unbrella along to the trainstop just like the earlier days their love began. 

Sure,they fell in love again.
