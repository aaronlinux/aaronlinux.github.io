Lecture 2: Shipping demand
===
1. In maritime transportation, the demand for shipping is usually measured by the actual volume of cargoes carried in a certain time period. As in the Figure 2-1, the total number of TEU lifts is used to calculate the annual growth rate of demand in the world. Explain the differences between the definition of demand in theory and this practical usage, and discuss the possible reasons for such a usage in real world. 
2. Compare the similarities and differences between consumer demand and profit-maximizing input demand, and discuss how market prices contributes to the decision making process of consumer and producer. 
3. Compare the difference between:
- a.Consumer demand and input demand
- b.Quantity demanded and demand
- c.Change in quantity demanded and demand shift
- d.Demand function and demand curve

4. For the change in each of the following factors, identify and explain whether it will lead to change in quantity demanded, demand shift, or no impact on demand in shipping. 
- a.Exchange rate change
- b.Oil price
- c.Natural disasters 
- d.International relationship
- e.Cost reduction in cross continental freight rail 
- f.Expansion of Panama Canal
5. For two ports serving the same hinterland or two carriers calling the same ports, they can be complements or substitutes. Explain the condition for them to be complements or substitutes.  
6. How to understand that the market demand for international shipping is inelastic in general, but the demand for individual shipping company may be very elastic? 
7. What are the causes for business cycles, and how they affect the world economy and shipping market? 
8. The new US President, Donald J. Trump, will implement its policy to bring the fact ories back to US, and “buy American,hire American”. Please discuss how this will affect the demand for international trade, especially for liner shipping industry. 

**Calculation question**

A: The demand for Teddy Bearat U.S. market is p=400-0.25q (p: the price; q: quantity of Teddy Bear). A toy producing company, Teddy Inc., is the only manufacturer in Hong Kong for this product. The cost function for producing Teddy Bear is C=0.2q^2+2q+10 (q: the number of Teddy Bears, cost in HK$). The shipping cost from HK to US West Coast Port (WP) is HK$4 each, to East Coast port (EP) is about HK$5 each. There are two distribution centers in the US for this product, one for the west part of US (WDC), and the other for the east part(EDC). Each distribution center handles half of its national demand. The unit cost for rail transportation from each port to the center at the same side is $1, and $3 to the center at the other side. The port costs for one Teddy Bear are the same at two US ports, which is about HK$1.5 each. The port cost at Hong Kong is about HK$2 each. Assume each distribution center handles half of the national demand. 
1. How many Teddy Bears to produce?
2. What is the total cost for so many Teddy Bears?
3. What is the demand for each Coastal ports?
4. What is the total profit the export company can earn?

Lecture 3: Shipping supply
===
1. Assume there are 3 ship owners providing transportation services for crude oil in the market, each with different supply function as listed below:
- Ship owner 1:  q1=10+0.3p
- Ship owner 2:  q2=-50+0.6p
- Ship owner 3:   q=-75+p
- A)Use a graph to show the supply function of the three ship owners.
- B)Write out the industry supply function
- C)Draw the industry supply function in another graph. 

2. Explain the important factors affecting market supply andindividual supply in maritime transportation?
3. How to measure ship productivity? What are the major factors affecting ship productivity, and how?
4. What is the relationship between new building price and freight rate? Is new building demand sensitive to the price of new ships? 
5. If a shipowner’s variablecost functionisC(q)=0.08q2, where q is the number of TEUs carried in a trip. When the market freight rate is $1600 per TEU, what is the optimal quantity the shipshould carry in that trip? What arethe total revenue, total cost, and profit for this trip?
6. The figure in the next page shows the short run marginal cost curve (SMC), average total cost function (ATC) and average variable cost function of one ship. There are three possible freight rates marked p1,p2, and p3. Please identify the best strategy of the ship owner at these three different freight rates. For each of the freight rate, please identify 
- (a) whether the ship owner can make positive profit, 
- (b) whether the ship owner want to layup the ship temporally. 


Lecture 4: Market behavior
===
1. The  State  council  decided  to  build  Shanghai  into  an International  Shipping  Center,  and build  a  tower  called “International Ocean Shipping & Finance Center”(上海國際航運金融大廈) in Pudong, Shanghai in 1996.It is supposed to  become  a  market  place  for  the  transactions  in  the international shipping. However, most of the spaces are used as offices, hotel and tourism sites. Pleaseexplain the problems in the original purpose of this building, and what kinds of transactions need a market place like this?   
2. How  to  understand  that  the invisible  hand  in  free  market economic system can ensure the efficient resource allocation among buyers/consumers? 
3. What is the impact of a sales tax on certain product on the market transaction of this product? 

For example, the demand and supply of shipping services for domestic shipping companies is shown in  the  figure  below.  Now  assume  that  the government is considering imposing a sales tax of dollars on every unit shipped. What is impact on the equilibrium  price  and  quantity,  the  consumer surplus, producer surplus, and the change in total social welfare?
4. Continue  with  questionabove,  assuming  that  the market for shipping services is open to the shipping companies  from  other  countries.  Therefore,  the demand for the domestic shipping services is very sensitive to the price change, due to the high competition. What are the impacts to the market equilibrium price, quantity, and the social welfare for the country for the proposed sales tax?
5. What is the impact of import tax on the social welfare of the importing country? Assume the domestic demand and supply for a certain consumer goods is Qdand Qs(as shown in the next figure), then the domestic equilibrium price and quantity of transaction for such goods are P*and Q*. If the world price for such goods is only Pw, then the domestic price is much higher than the world price. What is the social welfare increase iffree trade is allowed? Then, if the government want to put a tax on every unit imported, what will be the new price in the domestic market, and what is the social welfare loss compared with no import tax?
6. It is usually claimed in international shipping that the demand for shipping is not sensitive to the changes in shipping price. However, the supply is usually considered elastic due to the profit maximizing behavior. To increase shipping supply, the usual method is to build more ships. As it take time to build a ship, the supply changes after observed the market prices. Using a graph to explain the possible reasons why the freight rate in shipping market does not converge to stable market equilibrium. 
7. On January 29, 2015, the BDI index dropped to around 600 points, a 30-year low level. What are the possible reasons for such a low market index? Using a market model to explain the reasons you suggested.
